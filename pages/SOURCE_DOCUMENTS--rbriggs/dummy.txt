Ode to the Deadly Bride of Kill Bill

In a chapel where vows were to spill,
Bullets instead did fulfill,
A wedding's bright future, to kill,
Bill's wicked intent, with his thrill.

The Bride in her gown, blood did soak,
Her heart and her dreams, all but broke.
Yet death's grip faltered, she awoke,
Vengeance her path, she bespoke.

Four years in silence, she lay still,
Plotting the course, of her will.
A list in her mind, to distill,
Names she would cross, with sharp skill.

First was Vernita, in disguise,
A homely facade, full of lies.
A knife through the cereal, her demise,
A daughter saw, with young eyes.

Next was O-Ren, in the snow,
Cottonmouth's head, a fierce blow.
The 88's, quite the show,
The Bride was fierce, her sword aglow.

To Tokyo and back again,
Her warrior's heart, she must train.
For each mark, she would attain,
With righteous fury, in her vein.

Bill’s brother Budd, in a bar,
Trailer trash king, no star.
Buried her alive, in a car,
But she punched through, near and far.

Then came Elle, the treacherous snake,
With one eye left, all for fate's sake.
They fought hard, the earth did quake,
An eye plucked out, a life to take.

At last, she found her Bill, so sly,
With truth that stung, her heart’s cry.
Her daughter lived, no need to pry,
A moment tender, under sky.

A mother's love, now to bestow,
Her sword still hung, no longer for show.
The Five Point Palm, Bill's final woe,
His steps were counted, and then slow.

In the end, the Bride did stand,
Her daughter’s hand within her hand.
Her vengeance sated, her rage spanned,
Peace for her soul, across the land.

And so concludes this epic tale,
Of blood and death, beyond the pale.
With humor dark, and love's travail,
The legacy of Kill Bill, we hail.
